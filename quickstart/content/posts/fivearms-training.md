I want to improve in Rocket League, and given my current skills, rank, available time, and desire to rank up, I think I should focus on just a few mechanics at a time. I am currently focusing on:

-   Directional Air Roll
-   Aerial Shot Power
-   Backboard Doubles

This document is intended to be a resource open to anyone looking to improve in Rocket League, but is guided by my personal understanding, training, and goals. I hope this record of my own quest for self-betterment can offer something useful to you in your own journey.

Mechanics are any named, repeatable action that a player can take in the game. Dribbling the ball and wavedashing are both mechanics. Some mechanics involve the ball, and others do not.

Given this, I attempt to break down the game into mechanics (what you can do with the car or car &amp; ball), and strategy (how you should use your car to win the game).

I also provide some instruction for basic training that works on many skills at once. If you are familiar with weight training, individual mechanics can be likened to machine-training that isolates muscles, whereas these training exercises are more like free weight exercises - compound exercises that involve many muscle groups.

## Car Control {#car-control}


### Accelerate {#accelerate}

Accelerate the car by using the accelerate button. While on the ground, this will move the car forward at an increasing pace. In the air, this also moves the car forward a very small amount. REFERENCE The car can also be accelerated by [dodging](#dodge--flip) and [boosting](#boost). The car has a maximum speed. When approaching maximum speed, the car will reach a threshold just below maximum speed and above this threshold, the car is said to be "supersonic." When a car is supersonic it will have a trail and it will be moving fast enough to "demo" or demolish another car.

### Dribbling {#dribbling}

Dribbling is the epitome of ball control. If you go into freeplay and
try to hit the ball and then make a second hit as quickly as possible,
after a while you start trying to _constantly_ hit the ball. That's
basically dribbling. Always touching/hitting the ball.

This level of ball control is required for many other mechanics like
[flicking](#flicks) and air-dribbling. The earlier you can start
dribbling, the better.

### Flicks {#flicks}

Flicks allow a player to quickly transfer a lot of momentum to the ball
from their car. This is accomplished by getting multiple touches on the
ball, rotating the car, and taking advantage of the dodge/flip mechanic
to add momentum directly.

### Wavedash {#wavedash}

Wavedash is a term borrowed from the Super Smash Brothers Melee fighting
game, and refers (in Rocket League) to a mechanic that helps a player
gain momentum. By combining the effect of increased player momentum from
a dodge/flip with running the car into the ground, one can quickly gain
speed. See
[Rocket
Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfKidiMlHTBRNkQZlLzUesw)'s video on
[dodge momentum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX950bhGhJE) for
reference.

The simplest explanation: give a dodge input (direction and jump) when
only two of the four car wheels are touching the ground. The car will
immediately gain momentum from having "dodged." The car will also
attempt to rotate, but because the ground is in the way, it will only
slam the car flat to the ground and allow the player to keep their new
momentum.


#### Curvedash {#curvedash}

Wavedashing without boost, while making use of any curved surface to
shorten the airborne duration of the dash. Explained concisely and
precisely by
[Rocket
Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfKidiMlHTBRNkQZlLzUesw) in his video on the subject:
[Curvedashing New
mechanic? Instant supersonic with no boost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuB6yLVSs5s)


#### Landing Wavedash {#landing-wavedash}

The general idea is that you land with your front wheels first, and
execute a wavedash as soon as the rear wheels touch down. Due to the
car's suspension, your jump should leave the back wheels on the ground,
making the wavedash nearly instantaneous.

Please see the
[Rocket
Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfKidiMlHTBRNkQZlLzUesw) video on the subject:
[Landing Wavedash when you
don't have a dodge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baNsqFEfRMY)

My tips: - keep your car in your peripheral vision like you would
wavedashing in a game; you're better at knowing the timing than you
think! - hold forward (pitch forward) as you land, and make your two
jump presses as close together as possible (wheelie press, dash press);
N.B. pitching forward pulls the rear wheels up and requires delaying the
wheelie press - experiment with having forward momentum or not; I think
holding accelerate the whole time helps

### Speedflip {#speedflip}

Rocket League is easier when you are faster than your opponents. Dodging
(flipping) is one of the easiest and most common ways to increase your
car's speed. If every flip you do is the fastest possible flip, then you
will be at an advantage.

Because diagonal flips are the best way to increase your forward
momentum (see [dodge momentum resource](#dodge-momentum-explanation)),
we want to use them but cancel their forward-pitch rotation (see
[speedflip tutorials](#youtube-tutorials)). This combined with
precise timing and recovery should allow us to quickly increase our
car's forward momentum faster than any other mechanic.

My best summary of how to speedflip (once you understand the mechanic
generally) is: flip-cancel as _early_ as possible, and recover as _late_
as possible. Cancel the dodge **immediately**, then wait as long as you
can to flip the stick again for your recovery.

### Walldash {#walldash}


#### A Caveat {#a-caveat}

Dashing on the wall requires sticking to the wall after a dodge executed
from low height (off the wall). IIRC, the fake, sticky force that glues
cars to non-ground surfaces is increased with car speed. This means that
walldashing is _easiest at top speed_ and gets harder the slower your
car is when you start. (See
[Kevpert's
video](https://youtu.be/gDfm4zPwVZw?si=MX-jslexkCbUccEz&t=472) for more here.) Again, being sub-sonic makes walldashing harder.
(I think Kevpert even suggests needing to be about 70 or 80% max speed.)


#### What is a Walldash? {#what-is-a-walldash}

A walldash is executed by a car when it drives along a wall, jumps,
immediately dodges up the wall (toward the ceiling), and lands
(sticking) to the wall it had just jumped from.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Why can't we just do the definition?

    There are two problems with a naïve attempt at a walldash.

    1.  A side-dodge gives a momentum boost in the direction of the
        side-dodge. If the car dodges perfectly "up" (toward the ceiling)
        when driving parallel to the ground, the car does **not** gain forward
        momentum. To gain momentum in the driving direction, the dodge must
        have a forward component (i.e. must be a diagonal dodge). Dodging up
        (even diagonally) will start turning the car up the wall. This can be
        countered by pointing the nose of the car "down" (toward the ground)
        before executing the dodge "up." (n.b. This is the same technique
        used for speed-flipping in a straight line. This means that there can
        be some variance in how players achieve this effect. The difference
        in turning before or after jumping will be the speed with which the
        nose of the car actually changes direction. On the wall, the car's
        turning speed will be the determining factor. In the air, the car's
        rotational acceleration around the z-axis will be the determining
        factor.)


#### How to Walldash {#how-to-walldash}

There are three steps to a walldash that, when executed precisely, can
be chained into consecutive walldashes (chain-dashing). The following
list includes step one as a prerequisite - steps two, three, and four
form the "chainable" walldash.

1.  Drive near top-speed along a wall (parallel to the ground).
2.  Turn the nose of the car down (toward the ground) slightly.
3.  Jump (neutral-jump) off the wall.
4.  Immediately, diagonally-dodge up-forward (toward the ceiling and
    driving direction).


#### Extra Considerations {#extra-considerations}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Deadzones

    You have access to two settings in RL that change how controller input
    is read and interpreted. These are the "controller deadzone" and the
    "dodge deadzone" (hereafter CDZ and DDZ respectively).

    First, understand that your controller is _always_ giving analog-stick
    (joystick) input to the game whether you are touching the controller or
    not. The stick measures two values at all times: radial deflection and
    angular deflection. In other words: how far from center the stick is
    pushed (radial deflection), and at what angle the stick is pushed
    (angular deflection). These two values are measured and sent to your
    computer at the "polling rate" of the controller. For our purposes this
    means "constantly," but in actuality it happens between 200--1200 times
    a second depending on your settings and controller.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Controller Deadzone

        Because the controller is always telling the game where its stick is and
        the controller isn't a perfect device, there will almost always be some
        non-zero value being registered and sent to the game. This is why the
        CDZ exists. By making the CDZ just larger than the "I'm not touching the
        stick, but it's reading a non-zero value," the game can _ignore_ that
        input and treat it as zero. Use [a
        testing software](https://www.gamepad-tester.com) to see your controller's highest radial deflection
        after moving and releasing the stick. Set your CDZ in Rocket League to
        the closest but higher value. For example: after flicking the stick then
        reading the "at rest" value a few times, you see your controller reads
        0.045, 0.067, 0.059, etc. You then set your CDZ in RL to 0.07 (as close
        to your highest reading as you can get while still being greater).

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Dodge Deadzone

        In order for a player's second jump input to be a dodge (instead of a
        neutral-jump), the game must register a coincident, radial stick
        deflection. In other words: to dodge, you must push the stick in (any)
        direction some minimum amount. How much? To a value greater than your
        dodge deadzone. For walldashing, the smaller the DDZ, the less stick
        movement required for dodging, and therefore the faster one can give
        dodge input. (n.b. Making the DDZ lower than the CDZ means all second
        jumps are dodges.) Set your DDZ as low as you can without accidentally
        getting dodge inputs in game (if you start accidentally backflipping all
        the time, you need a bigger DDZ). I use a value near 0.70, but this is
        different for everyone.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  How does this relate to walldashing?

        Use [HalfwayDead's tool to
        visualize your deadzones](https://halfwaydead.gitlab.io/rl-deadzone/). In the graph on the right, you can see your
        dodge input with diagonal dodge input registering only when the stick is
        in the green sections of the circle. Notice that changing the DDZ
        doesn't change the angular area of the diagonal dodge sections at all.
        Notice that making the CDZ bigger reduces the angular area of the
        diagonal dodge sections, and making it _smaller_ will _increase_ the
        available angles for getting a diagonal dodge. (n.b. Also notice that a
        smaller CDZ makes it easier to turn or harder to drive straight.)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Hitboxes

    I can't confirm anything here, but given that each car has a unique
    wheel placement relative to their hitbox, some cars may bonk and not
    stick more than others. Similarly, because each hitbox preset has a
    unique turning radius (see
    [HalfwayDead's spreadsheet](http://cars.rocketscience.fyi/)), the
    amount of turning needed to correct the dodge on the wall may be
    slightly different for each hitbox preset.


### Aerials {#aerials}

-   [Thanovic aerial
    car control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=141&v=d_7VLNiHgY8)


#### Fast Aerials {#fast-aerials}

Fast aerialing refers to moving your car from the ground up to some
height in the fastest possible way. Constantly boosting while getting
maximum "up-force" from your jumps will be the tools used to fight
gravity. Practice, timing, and coordination will let you go up faster.

While boosting: press and hold jump for 0.2 seconds, and pitch up by
pulling back on your left stick. Continue boosting, but let your stick
return to a neutral position. Keep boosting, input another full jump,
then pitch up some more with your stick. All together: hold boost, jump,
tilt, jump, tilt (aim).

You want to hold your first jump for 0.2 seconds. You can practice with
a metronome set to 250bpm. See
[Rocket
Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfKidiMlHTBRNkQZlLzUesw)'s video for explanation: <https://youtu.be/Y9o8ZPEwwK8?t=687>


#### Aerial Control {#aerial-control}

Controlling your car in the air is the first step to using the air to
your advantage. See Kingpin's video's for introductions:

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxRgoqwnW6Y> Simplified
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XimS3RBAVlQ> Using pillars

Try using Dreale's workshop map for a built-in training experience:
<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1816559771>


#### Directional Air Roll {#directional-air-roll}

First, we must establish a common vocabulary. When the car is in the
air, it can rotate around three axes just like a plane (see
[principle axes
resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes)) and these three rotations are controlled by the left analog
stick. Up/down on the stick gives pitch control, left/right gives yaw
control, and if the "air roll" button is held then left/right instead
gives roll control. Since left/right analog stick movement corresponds
to both roll and yaw control, it is impossible to give both inputs
simultaneously without binding additional control buttons. The "air roll
left" and "air roll right" bindings provide a button that gives their
named inputs and free up the left/right stick to give simultaneous yaw
control.

-   stick `up/down` gives `+/-` pitch (up/down)
-   stick `left/right` gives `-/+` yaw (left/right)
-   "air roll" and stick `left/right` gives `-/+` roll (left/right)
    -   "air roll left" gives `-` roll (left)
    -   "air roll right" gives `+` roll (right)

From a neutral position (hovering in the air, nose up, tail down, top
facing you), we can boost through various rotations to move the car's
position while leaving its final orientation the same as its initial
orientation. Boosting through any of these rotational control inputs
provides consistent control as follows:

| Roll | Pitch | Yaw | RESULT   |
|------|-------|-----|----------|
| -    | +     | 0   | RIGHT    |
| -    | -     | 0   | LEFT     |
| -    | 0     | +   | BACKWARD |
| -    | 0     | -   | FORWARD  |

The first row of the table can be read as the following: by starting
from the neutral position and boosting while holding "air roll left",
holding the left analog stick up, and not holding the stick left/right -
all for one full rotation of the car - the car will have moved to the
right and returned to the neutral position. Or more succinctly:

-   Roll (left/negative) + Pitch (up/positive) + Yaw (neutral) = rightward
    motion

### Kickoffs {#kickoffs}

The original, gold-standard for kick-off:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFn3Ye90IKc> If you can do this style of
kickoff well, you will be doing better kickoffs than at least half of
the playerbase.

Here are two general guides for getting the basics of kickoffs: -

getting there first and best :

#### Cheat-up {#cheat-up}

This is where you grab a couple 12-pads and follow behind the first
player to immediately follow up the kickoff 50/50.


#### Dead-ball {#dead-ball}

When the kickoff 50/50 results in the ball mostly staying in the center
circle. The ball's momentum is "dead." Excellent opportunity for a
teammate if they cheated up.

## Miscellaneous Tips {#miscellaneous-tips}

These are poorly documented tips that I've either synthesized myself or
have come directly from other (better) Rocket League players. I have not
done well to attribute individual contributions here, and I apologize.
Persons contributing include - but are not limited to - xHardDrive,
Nekrosisx, PlantDaddyGaming, Rylak09, and Unknown.

-   don't give it to them
-   In game? unlucky. During review? mistake.
-   rotate backpost/backwall at kickoff
-   think about the way you turn (what are you covering?)
-   challenge the flip-reset early when it's at penalty box or closer
-   "fake far, go close"
-   don't be in the same offensive corner as your partner
-   pass laterally not in a straight line
-   if you're going to challenge a ball in a corner, dive for it and go
    all-in.
-   powerslide-jump off backboard landings (or any surface)
-   use big circles to idle in good places
-   wavedash-flips - they're huge (for recoveries)

### 1v1 Tips {#v1-tips}

-   take diagonal lines - don't go straight at the goal/goalie


### 2v2 Tips {#v2-tips}

-   keep momentum, don't stop yourself
-   don't throw the ball to them helpfully
-   don't get antsy and dive in to force a play
-   height makes right - at least make them waste boost
-   if he's in the air, don't be there
-   never go into the corner your teammate is in
-   If you think you need to hit (but only around 1st), 50 it instead
-   possession and aggression - have the ball, then aggress when they have
    the ball. Make them _have_ to give it away.
-   first man only covers bad-hits and no-hits; second covers strong-hits
    (zones)
-   shadow along wall all the way to your own corner
-   as last back: fake-challenge, buy time, save
-   don't push ball through corner uselessly (possession play through
    corners; or bump!)


### 3v3 Tips {#v3-tips}

-   if you're first: dive, attack, commit, go; if you're last: shadow till
    the ball is on the goal-line
-   gotta challenge
-   don't rotate ball-side
-   go under them, not over them (especially in your half)
