Overall, today was a good day. I didn't start stream on time, but that's just personal life stuff getting in the way. We'll do better with that over time. I was very proud of my solo-queuing, and I think I did as well as I could when playing with Plant.

I got some good solo-queuing in this morning on `wheredoibelong`, and I was able to incorporate a lot of advice from chat on how to play both more patiently, but also adding in speed that my teammate wasn't providing.

I only left myself a few minutes to fight Eigong in Nine Sols, but it went well! It was a good mental break while I ate lunch. I made it into third phase twice, and died both times by not appropriately jumping over her red, mid-air attack. I'll get her next time for sure.

Playing 2s with PlantDaddyGaming was tougher than I had hoped it would be. There were some issues at the start of our session, where RL wasn't working properly and we both had to restart everything multiple times. Once we got into matches, I felt like I did a lot very well, but there was a pretty big disconnect on our offense. I felt like I kept getting the ball into good places, but he'd be too far back. And then when I'd have an easy shot, he'd cut me off or not rotate out. Oh well. Not much I feel like I can do about it. Hopefully we'll both get feedback from higher-level players. Ranked record: (:PDG: (1 3) (3 2) (2 3))
